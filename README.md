# Higgs boson detection
In this project for the EPFL machine learning class, we will do exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and its features, feature processing and engineering to clean the dataset and extract more meaningful information, implement and use machine learning methods on real data, analyze our model and generate predictions using  those methods and report our findings.

The dataset stems from one of the most popular machine learning challenges recently - finding the Higgs boson - using original data from CERN.

## Team members
