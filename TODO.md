-Exploratory data analysis (get rid with the data with no correlation) 

-Baseline--Apply methods (regression or logistic) without working on the data before. Make a table with the baseline data.

-Normalize/standardise data. Why? (Deal with -999 values)

-Find (3) feature processings which have to be tested with the methods (polynomials, cross-products, ..)

-Cost functions (MSE,MAE) ?

Different methods
-Least_squares (using normal, GD or SGD)
-ridge_regression
-Logistic regression (Regularized or not)
